# Truss-Analysis-
A Python-based structural analysis tool for 2D trusses with internal forces,stress, strain, failure checks, and validation using ANSYS.
This project presents a Python-based tool for analyzing two-dimensional truss structures under various loading conditions. It calculates internal forces, stresses, strains, and nodal deflections, and performs failure checks based on yield strength and Euler's buckling criteria. The tool is built using fundamental concepts from Mechanics of Solids and integrates symbolic computation for solving equilibrium equations. Additionally, results from the Python code are validated against ANSYS finite element simulations, ensuring accuracy and reliability. 

Steps to use:

- Make the truss geometry in geogebra
  - Draw external loads using vector
  - Define ROLL and PIN joints
- Save the file in the python path
- Run the main.py, code will compute internal forces, stress,strain and displacment of nodes
